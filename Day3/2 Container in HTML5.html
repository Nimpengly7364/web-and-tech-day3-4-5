        <p>Social media is a big part of our daily lives, changing how we talk,
            share, and connect. It has many benefits, like improving communication
            and allowing self-expression, but also comes with problems like privacy
            issues, online bullying, misinformation, and too much screen time
            affecting mental health. It's important to use social media carefully, be
            aware of the risks, and balance online and real-life interactions. The
            impact of social media depends on our choices, so practicing responsible
            use is essential.</p>
